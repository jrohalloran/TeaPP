    directory.

4)  After the file type is checked, the file statistics are displayed
    before the user for choose to start uploading the file via the
    "Upload" button.

The uploaded pedigree data can be manually reviewed to ensure pedigree
integrity before storage. "Invalid" Clone IDs, those that don't match
the Brown/Lipton nomenclature, are flagged and displayed to the user to
view.

Pedigree validation page includes (Figure M 7):

1)  **Invalid offspring manual formatting**

> This allows the user to manually reformat or remove offspring records
> in the dataset where its "ID" does not match the Brown/Lipton
> nomeclature.

2)  **Invalid parental removal or updating**

> This allows the user to manually reformat parental records in the
> dataset where its "ID" does not match the Brown/Lipton nomeclature.

3)  **Use the Search feature**

> This allows the user to manually search against their uploaded dataset
> to reformat clone IDs based existing entries to ensure they match, and
> the lineage integrity is retained.

#### Assessing Invalid Offspring 

The invalid offspring, those bred resulting from the breeding programme
that do not match the nomeclature are highlighted in the displayed
table.

![](media/media/image14.svg){width="5.905555555555556in"
height="3.34375in"}Figure M 8: Invalid Offspring GUI. The user can
manually reformat the Clone IDs of the invalid offspring (1) or select
them for removal (2). (3) Option to select all those in the list or (4)
only offspring that have not been used as active breeders in the
population based on their ID. (5) Then the user can proceed to reviewing
the invalid parental records.

The user can follow these steps to update the clone IDs (Figure \_\_):

1)  The user can manually type in the reformatted Clone ID into the
    corresponding input bar.

2)  Entries for removal can be selected via the "Remove" column by click
    the check-box. This highlights the entry in red.

3)  Optionally the user can click "Select all to remove" -- this will
    highlight all entries displayed to be removed.

4)  Alternatively, "Select all unused" allows the user to select only
    those that are not used as breeding parents in the dataset.

5)  "Next" moves the GUI to the next reviewing page for the user to
    review invalid parents/founders. The reformatted entries are not
    uploaded until after this step.

#### Assessing Invalid Parents/Founders

The invalid parental records, those that have been used as parents but
do not correspond to an offspring records, therefore are potential
founders, can be reviewed.

![Figure M 9: GUI displaying invalid parental records. These parental
entries do not match a record within the dataset, so are flagged as
founders or erroneous. The user can choose to (1) Manually reformat the
clone ID and (2) check that is corresponds to an entry before (3)
finalising the uploading of the data to
TeaPP.](media/media/image16.svg){width="5.905555555555556in"
height="3.78125in"}

The user can review parental records by:

1)  Manually reformatting the clone ID of the record.

2)  "Update" allows the user to send the reviewed entries for comparison
    against the dataset. If any of the reformatted entries
    correspond/match parental records present in the dataset then
    dataset and list are updated accordingly. The new list is displayed
    to the user.

3)  "Upload" confirms the reviewing and formatting of both invalid
    offspring and parental records. This starts the final processing and
    uploading pipeline.

4)  After the data upload is finalised, the user is redirected to the
    Home Page of TeaPP to start data analysis and exploration.

### Pedigree Summary & Descriptive Statistics

Upon reaching the Home Page, TeaPP calculates summary statistics for the
uploaded pedigree data (Figure ). This includes descriptive statistics
and metrics detailing characteristics such as the frequency of offspring
per generation, year, or the number of twins identified.

(1)The default visualisation for a pedigree dataset appears in the top
container. One a node is selected/ searched a secondary pedigree
detailing the respective linear pedigree family is displayed in the
bottom container (2). The side panels contain (3) Zoom In/Out controls,
(4) Pedigree layout parameters, (5) Plant Search Bar, (6) Basic
Statistics on the Secondary diagram. (7) The node colour legend for
displayed graph.

### Pedigree Layout Parameters

The top container, displaying the entire pedigree dataset can be
modified via the selection of a range of parameters.

[Filtered:]{.underline}

> If selected, the nodes are filtered by use as a breeding individual.
> Plants that do not have descendants of a higher generation (children)
> are removed, unless they are of the most recent generation, then they
> are retained.

[Layer By:]{.underline}

> **Year** - Nodes are layered ascending (earliest to latest) order of
> their cross "year" as determined by the Brown/Lipton nomenclature.
> "Founders" are manually layered at the top.
>
> **Generation** -- Nodes are layered by their assigned "generation"
> (Synbreed - (Wimmer et al., 2012) in ascending order (oldest to
> youngest).

[Group By:]{.underline}

> **Siblings** -- Plants that are year-wide-siblings (same parents, same
> year) are aggregated as represented as a single node.
>
> **None** -- All nodes that present are represented individually.

[Colour:]{.underline}

> **Year** - Nodes are coloured ascending (earliest to latest) order of
> their cross "year" as determined by the Brown/Lipton nomenclature.
>
> **Generation** -- Nodes are coloured by their assigned "generation"
> (Synbreed - (Wimmer et al., 2012).

[Node Size:]{.underline}

> **No. of Descendant's** -- The node's size is scaled to the number of
> identified descendants within the population.
>
> **None** -- Nodes remain the uniform default size.

The "default" visualisation is set to be filtered, grouped by siblings,
layered by year, coloured by generation and no node scaling.
